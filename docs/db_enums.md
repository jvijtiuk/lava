What do the numbers that appear in the db tables attackpoint and bug in the type column mean?
They are defined in two places, lava.py and lava.hxx.

attackpoint types:

0. `FUNCTION_ARG`  (an arg to a fn)
1. `POINTER_READ`  (read via ptr)
2. `POINTER_WRITE` (write via ptr)
3. `QUERY_POINT`   (is this the sentinels ricky puts in after every stmt?)
4. `PRINTF_LEAK`   (really just a printf)

bug types:

0. `PTR_ADD`       (corrupt a pointer at attack point)
1. `RET_BUFFER`    (stack pivot)
2. `REL_WRITE`     (This was a is a write-what-where but is now a misnomer for a 3-dua variation on a `PTR_ADD` bug)
3. `PRINTF_LEAK`   (turn printf into a stack / heap leak)
